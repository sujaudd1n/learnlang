# About

LearnLang resource designed to help you learn a
new language while building on the knowledge you already have. We believe
that the key to learning a new language is not just about memorizing rules
and syntax, but about understanding the underlying principles and concepts
that make it tick.

Our approach is inspired by the idea of teaching you
how to "fish" - that is, giving you the tools and guidance to become
proficient in learning new languages, rather than just introducing you to a
specific framework or stack. We want to empower you with the conceptual
vocabulary to rapidly learn new languages, so you can adapt to the ever-changing
landscape of programming languages and technologies.

We're not trying to be an
exhaustive resource, but rather a starting point that helps you understand the
big picture. We'll provide a high-level overview of the language's
building blocks, library management, testing, and more, to help you get up to
speed fast. And for those who want to dive deeper, we'll provide additional
resources and links to help you explore each topic in more detail.

Our project
is specifically geared towards programmers who already know one
programming language and want to learn a new one quickly and efficiently. We're
not here to teach you programming from scratch, but rather to help you
leverage your existing knowledge to pick up a new language.
